Projeto 1 de aprendizagem no Unity.

I call this a project and not a necessary a game because the main intention was to create, explore and implement different mechanics while continuing to learn how to create games.

The main areas explored are about physics and the creation of a platform-puzzle.
Movement of the player;
Movement of projectiles ( axe );
Designing a puzzle and managing the state of the various objects involved;
